# What's the Weather Like?

## Description

The purpose of this project was to take the user's input (a city of their choice) and display a five-day weather forecast for that city. 

This project relies on two APIs from `openweathermap.org`: '5 Day Weather Forecast' and 'Geocode.' 

'Geocode' takes the user's input and fetches the latitude and longitude information for that city.

'5 Day Weather Forecast' takes the latitude and longitude information retrieve by the Geocode API and fetches weather information for that city.

The web app then traverses the information for relevant weather information and displays it on the web page.

## Errors

In its current state, the app does not properly display the recent searches. I believe this has to do with the way the search history information is retrieved from the array. This will be fixed in later builds.
